Debate is a valuable tool in the pursuit of truth, however our human flaws so often corrupt the process of debate and impede the pursuit of truth.  Our flaws and our tribal nature leads us to use logical fallacies, emotional manipulation, psychological manipulation, deception and more in debate and if we are to succeed in our quest for truth we need a tool to facilitate high quality debate in order to effectively navigate our human flaws and find the best path forward as a society.
